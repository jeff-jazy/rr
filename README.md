## How to Play

**1.**  The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

**2.**  You are  **O**, your friend is  **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

**3.**  The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

**4.**  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
